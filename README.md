Star Wars Themed Crystal Collection Game

Here's how the app works:
There will be four droids displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a droid, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
When the player does click one of the droids, the players score counter will update.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the droids will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. 
The random number shown at the start of the game is between 19 - 120.
Each droid has a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
